It's been silent here recently. While I have nothing exciting to share in the personal blog, I work for GitHub in Security Lab. You may still follow my research here:
* [Everything Security Lab finds eventually is published as advisories](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/).
* [The old "blog" by Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/research/). 
* [New articles are published in GitHub main blog](https://github.blog/author/jarlob/).

And of course for security content you may follow me in the social networks: [https://twitter.com/yarlob](https://twitter.com/yarlob) and [https://infosec.exchange/@jaras](https://infosec.exchange/@jaras).
