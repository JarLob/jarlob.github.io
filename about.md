title: About me 
---
I am Application Security Researcher, static code analysis enthusiast, former Application Security Engineer, former Software Engineer with a solid development background. I have been on many sides: as a software developer, internal security auditor, external reporter, bug bounty submitter and triager.

I have started as a desktop and backend C++/C# developer. While one part of me enjoyed creating programs, my other passion always was finding cracks and breaking things. After some time I've moved into the Information Security field where I feel I found a balance: I enjoy writing security tools and performing technical security assessments. In my free time I like researching security of third party products (both closed and open source).  

Open source projects I am or was actively developing:  

[Security Code Scan](https://security-code-scan.github.io/) - Security static code analysis for C# and VB.NET.  
[Electronegativity](https://github.com/doyensec/electronegativity) - Vulnerability patterns detector for JavaScript/TypeScript Electron applications.
