title: About me 
---

I have started as desktop and backend C++/C# developer. While one part of me enjoyed creating programs, my other passion always was finding cracks and breaking things. After some time I've moved into Information Security field where I feel I found a balance: I enjoy writing security tools and performing technical security assessments. In my free time I like researching security of third party products (both closed and open source).  

Open source projects I am or was actively involved:  

[Security Code Scan](https://security-code-scan.github.io/) - Security static code analysis for C# and VB.NET.  
[Electronegativity](https://github.com/doyensec/electronegativity) - Vulnerability patterns detector for JavaScript/TypeScript Electron applications.  

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yarlob), [GitHub](https://github.com/JarLob), [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yarlob/) and you can reach me at jarlob+gh()gmail.com
